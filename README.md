Using the towards data science work done Javier Ideami to get a better understanding of how neural nets work with full explanations into the forward pass with activation functions alongside how the backwards pass works with backpropogation to understand how each weight affects the loss and improve the loss accuracy for the neural net. 

This process started with creating a neural net from scratch, training it using gradient descent and applying it to a cancer data set. 

This, alongside the Stanford lectures has improved my understanding of the concepts behind neural networks.
